### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

## Project Description
I am currently exploring the London Airbnb data for 2020 and I have the following business questions:

##### Question 1
- What is the average price for the different location?

##### Question 2
- What types of verifications are hosts using? How long did it take them to respond?

##### Question 3

  - Is it possible to predict the score?
  - What are the importance of the features?
  - Could the features be ranked?
