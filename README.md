## Project Description
I am currently exploring the London Airbnb data for 2020 and I have the following business questions:
- What features assist in obtaining a good review score? 
  - predict the score
  - importance of the features
  - rank features
- What types of holidays are people interested in? 
  - Classification?
  - Can a recommendation be created from the reviews?
- What is the average price for the different location? 
  - what would affect this price? 
  - rank features by importance

In turn I will create a web blog to show my findings.
