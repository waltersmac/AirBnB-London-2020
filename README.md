# Data Science Blog for London AirBNB 2020
This project is part of the Udacity - Data Science Nano-Degree.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand and imrove my knowledge of the CRISP-DM process. The main goals of the project is to ask business questions of the data, 

was the first project to really start promoting my skills around Data Science. The project idea came from the "Data Science Nano-Degree" with Udacity, I had completed projects before with Udacity, but i wanted to push the boardaries and use data that hadn't already been formated and shaped. 

### Methods Used 
- I will come up with three questions that I'm interested in answering.
- Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
- Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- Evaluate your results.
- Share your insights with stakeholders.

### Technologies (Currently)
* Python
* Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy 

## Project Description
I am currently exploring the London Airbnb data for 2020. My goal will be to ask three business questions and build a model. In turn I will create a web blog to show my findings. 
For this project, I will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of my own. 

### About the London AirBNB Data
I decided to look into the London AirBNB data to really challenge myself, data from Seattle and Boston AirBNB homes can be used to understand how much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas. You can compare rates between the two cities, or try to understand if there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price. Can you find negative and positive reviews based on text? This dataset requires a number of skills beyond those shown thus far in the course, but if you would like a challenge, this will certainly test your ability to work with messy, real world data.

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

*If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...
