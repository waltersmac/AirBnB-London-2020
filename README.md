# Data Science Blog for London AirBnB 2020

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Objective
For this project I decided to pick the AirBnbB data for London in 2019 ["Inside AirBnB"](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) website. Using this dataset, I choose to answer 3 questions that I aspired to answer. Also, the purpose of this project is to understand and improve my knowledge of the CRISP-DM process.
