## Project Description
I am currently exploring the London Airbnb data for 2020 and I have the following business questions:
**Question 1**
- What is the average price for the different location? 
**Question 2**
- What types of amenities are included in a listing? 
**Question 3**
- What features assist in obtaining a good review score? 
- predict the score
- importance of the features, rank features

In turn I will create a web blog to show my findings.
