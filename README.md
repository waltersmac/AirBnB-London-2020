This project is part of the Udacity - Data Science Nano-Degree.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
For this project, I pick a dataset from the "Inside AirBnB" website. Using your dataset, I choose 3 questions that I aspired to answer from the data. Also, the purpose of this project is to understand and improve my knowledge of the CRISP-DM process.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies (Currently)
* Python
* Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Project Description
I am currently exploring the London Airbnb data for 2020 and I have the following business questions:

**Question 1**
- What is the average price for the different location? 

**Question 2**
- What types of verifications are hosts using? How long did it take them to respond?

**Question 3**
- What features assist in predicting a price for any listing? 
  - Is it possible to predict the score?
  - What are the importance of the features? 
  - Could the features be ranked?


## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
