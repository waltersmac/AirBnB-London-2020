## Project Description
I am currently exploring the London Airbnb data for 2020 and I have the following business questions:

**Question 1**
- What is the average price for the different location? 

**Question 2**
- What types of verifications are hosts using? How long did it take them to respond?

**Question 3**
- What features assist in predicting a price for any listing? 
  - Is it possible to predict the score
  - What are the importance of the features? Could the features be ranked?

In turn I will create a web blog to show my findings.

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
